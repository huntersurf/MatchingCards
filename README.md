# MatchingCards
# Basic View and Controller, needs to be updated. 

// Start a new game and click two different cards, if they are a matching pair then both stay facing up,
// if they do not match they stay facing up for 2 seconds then face back down.

// The coding is based off of a YouTube series made by "CM Kandemir"
